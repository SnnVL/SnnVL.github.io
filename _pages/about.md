I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Colorado State University (CSU) in the Department of Atmospheric Science, where I employ theoretical and computational (such as artificial intelligence) methods to study climate dynamics, the radiative energy budget, and extreme events. Throughout my career, I have obtained experience in different scientific fields and departments, giving me unique insight into the broader field of science. I got my PhD in theoretical physics, but felt the urge to apply my scientific thinking to the more pressing challenges of climate change.

My [most recent work](/research/) has focused on using artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand climate processes that affect our planet. For example, I use AI methods to make better use of existing climate model simulations and connect them with observations. I also work towards advancing more traditional methods, by relaxing the normal assumption in [data assimilation](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/Mastering-Chaos-A-Spooky-Introduction-to-Data-Assimilation/) techniques.

As a physicist, I am trained to identify interesting research questions, recognize new techniques to investigate them, and solve the complex problems that arise. I believe in the importance of working in a diverse research environment, tackling high-impact issues such as climate change, and using novel machine-learning methods to **advance our collective knowledge**. With my working knowledge in different sciences, spanning climate science, physics, and mathematics, I am able to speak the language of scientists from various fields. My ability to translate complex concepts into accessible language for a wide range of audiences helps me in my quest to share my research with the broader public and teach students. As such, I have given multiple [popular science](/talks/) talks and workshops, and am the organizer of the Fort Collins chapter of [Nerd Nite](https://fortcollins.nerdnite.com/).
